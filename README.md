### The reason why I was trying to refectoring‚ùì

- It was not bad 'carrot game ver.1' before refectoring but I just wanted to practice to refectoring

### How did you do refectoring ‚ùì

- I divided 5 parts (main.js , popup.js , field.js , game.js , sound.js) by adding files

### main function üôå
1. make Class template & create new Object
2. module files (export & import)

## PopUp.js üéÅ

- This file is gathering functions related with popup from main.js
- This is faithful to their jobs which is showing popup banner and click event by refresh button

- how startGame() function can be executed in popUp class ? (rememebr their top scope) :
Although popUp class dosen't have information about startGame(), the reason why startGame() can be executed in popUp class is related their lexical scope. 
they remember their top scope reference as long as they exists.
When function declaration is evaluated, and function object is made,
they save their top scope reference to their environment. 

- this binding issue : The reason why I made arrow function when I send startGame() to their this.onClick memeber variable:
If I send only startGame() reference , 'this' information will disapear (this.onClick).

## Field.js üå≥

- This is the file related with field.
- show items(carrots and bugs) & click event on the field

1. make click event (remove items) 
2. add setClickListener : for processing score and other things outside (from main.js)

3. show items on the field

4. I didn't make all functions not using commonly as a 'Class'.For instance function 'randomNumber()'.because whenever I make new instance (new object),all Class member variables and functions would be applied even if they don't need ..which is unefficient.

### binding issue üí•
- when we send function as a parameter, information about Class dosen't send with parameter
- 'this.onItemClick' event error from function onClick()
- There are 3 ways we can solve this issue
1. using arrow function

2. using bind

3. make onClick function to member variable

## Sound.js üé∂

- This is a sound file 
- I didn't use Class for this file
- I made meaningful sound function so user can catch what it is about at once.

## Game.js üéÆ
### Main function
- game start & stop, make score, finish game banner(win,loose,replay)

### setGameStopListener 
- I wasn't able to make finsh game banner in game.js so I made this function to send to 'main.js' so that I can reference finishgamebanner üòÜ

### switch (main.js) 
- This is for making finishgamebanner that is referred from setGameStopListener in game.js
- Let's see down below!

### Build Pattern üëª

- const game = new Game(5, 5, 5) > parameter dosen't clear
- we can use builder for more clear recogination (naming)
- I exported 'class GameBuilder' instead of 'class Game'

### Object.freeze()‚ùÑÔ∏è

- For some users like me who often make a typo
- I made a strict object using freeze.

### remove finish()

- There are common functions so I tried to combine stop() with finish() as a one function
- both of them is almost similer
- make parameter : stop(reason)

1. original

2. change
