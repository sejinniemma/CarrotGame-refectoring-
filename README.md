# 🥕Carrot-game ver.2 (Refectoring)

### The reason why I was trying to refectoring❓

- It was not bad 'carrot game ver.1' before refectoring but I just wanted to practice to refectoring

### How did you do refectoring ❓

- I divided 5 parts (main.js , popup.js , field.js , game.js , sound.js) by adding files

## PopUp.js 🎁

- This file is gathering functions related with popup from main.js
- This is faithful to their jobs which is showing popup banner and click event by refresh button
